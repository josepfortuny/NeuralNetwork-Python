# NeuralNetwork-Python

## Use Case 
Is a neural network with three input layers and one output layer, with a sigmoid Function with the following 
The aim of this project is the creation of an adaptable Neural Network with two hidden layers where the user can specify the following character√≠stics:
* The number of Neurons in the first layer
* The number of Neurons in the second layer
* How many childs in each generation
* Number of generations 



## Installation 

You can check the requirements of this program in `Pipfile` file, install the dependencies using `pip PACKAGE_NAME`. To an easy an automaticaly installation you can use the virtual enviromenment tool `pipenv`.

Install `pipenv` with `pip install pipenv`.

Once installed and located in src folder use `pipenv install Pipfile`, this command will create the virtual enviroment and will install the dependencies.

## Usage 

To run the code use `pipenv run python . ` located in src folder. 

If you have installed the dependencies in your local python installation just use `python3 . `
